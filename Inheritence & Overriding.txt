Inheritance
---------------
- A class can be declared to inherit (a.k.a derive) from another class by using the "extends" keywords .
- Derived class has characteristics of base class and can add specialization on its own .
      - Fields hide base class fields with same name .
      - Can be assigned to base class typed references.
      - Methods override base class methods with same signature .

Method Overriding:
--------------------------
- If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java. In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.
- The methods must have the same name , same number of parameters and same type of parameters in it .
