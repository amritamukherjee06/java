Spring MVC
---------------
The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be 
used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications.The MVC pattern results in separating the different 
aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), 
while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

Request / Response Life-cycle
--------------------------------------
We have a Incoming Request which hits the Front Controller (It is just the dispatcher servlet inside of spring) . 
Then hands off the request(Delegate Request) over Controller . The controller then handles the request and hand 
it over to the Backend . In return the Backend hands back a model which is created by the Backend to the controller . 
the controller then Delegate Rendering to the Front Controller Then the model is passed to the View Template then 
the control is returned back to the Front Controller and response gets back to the browser .
