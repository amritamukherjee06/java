  -try/catch/finally provides a structured way to handle exceptions 

Try Block
------------

- Block executes to completion unless an exception is thrown . 

Catch Block
---------------
- Contains the error handling code
- Block executes only if matching exception is thrown .

Finally Block 
-----------------
- Contains cleanup code if needed
- Runs in all cases following try or catch block

Checked Exceptions
-------------------------
- we have to handle it . if the the compiler raises an error
- any class that inherits from Exception but not from RuntimeException are considered as checked Exception

Unchecked Exceptions
----------------------------
- we can handle it but if we don't the compiler won't raise any error .
- any exception class that inherits from RuntimeException is considered as Unchecked Exception .
