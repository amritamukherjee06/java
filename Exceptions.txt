Exception
-------------
Exception is a typical or exceptional condition that signals a piece of code could not execute normally . Exceptions provide a non-intrusive way to signal error
  -try/catch/finally provides a structured way to handle exceptions 

Try Block
------------
- Contains normal code to execute
- Block executes to completion unless an exception is thrown . 

Catch Block
---------------
- Contains the error handling code
- Block executes only if matching exception is thrown .

Finally Block 
-----------------
- Contains cleanup code if needed
- Runs in all cases following try or catch block

Checked Exceptions
-------------------------
- we have to handle it . if the the compiler raises an error
-  if a method is throwing a checked exception then it should handle the exception using try-catch block or it should declare the exception using throws keyword .
- any class that inherits from Exception but not from RuntimeException are considered as checked Exception

Unchecked Exceptions
----------------------------
- we can handle it but if we don't the compiler won't raise any error .
- Most of the times these exception occurs due to the bad data provided by user during the user-program interaction. 
- any exception class that inherits from RuntimeException is considered as Unchecked Exception .
