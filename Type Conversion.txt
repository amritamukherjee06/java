Type Conversion
----------------------
Operations in our applications deals with multiple data types that is why we need type conversion .
 
1. Implicit type conversion
----------------------------------
- Conversions performed automatically by the compiler 
- Widening conversions are automatic
- By Operating with Mixed Integer Sizes it uses the largest integer in equation.
- By Operating with Mixed Floating point sizes it uses double
- By Operating with Mixed integer and floating point it uses largest floating point in equation . 

Ex: int iVal = 50;
      long lVal = iVal;

2.Explicit type conversion
---------------------------------
- Conversions performed explicitly in code with cast operator 
- Can perform widening and narrowing
- Floating point to integer drops fraction
- Use caution with narrowing conversions
- Integer to floating point can lose precision .

Ex: long lVal = 50;
      int ival = (int) lVal;
