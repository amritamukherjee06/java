Conditional Logic
----------------------
Adding Conditional logic in our code means the program will work differently based on differences in data values .
 
1. Relational Operators(Used to test different values)
2. Conditional Assignments(Used to assign value differently based on conditions)
3. The if statement( allows to change the code path in the application)
4. Logical operators(uses to combine different conditions together)
