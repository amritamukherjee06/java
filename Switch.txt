Switch
---------
Transfer control to a statement based on a value
- Simplifies testing against multiple possible matches
- Only primitive types supported are char and integers
- A match can execute more than one statement
- Use break to avoid "falling through "
- Can optionally include default to handle any unmatched values

Syntax:
----------
             switch(test-value) {
             case value-1:
               statements;
                 break;
   	         case value-2:
        	    statements;
                break;
   	         .
   	         .
   	         .
     	        case value-n:
         	      statements;
                  break;
     	        default:
                 break;
     	         }
