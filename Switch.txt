Switch
---------
Transfer control to a statement based on a value
- Simplifies testing against multiple possible matches
- Only primitive types supported are char and integers
- A match can execute more than one statement
- Use break to avoid "falling through "
- Can optionally include default to handle any unmatched values

Syntax:
----------
                  switch(test-value) {
                       case value-1:
                         statements
   	        case value-2:
        	          statements
   	         .
   	         .
   	         .
     	        case value-n:
         	          statements
     	        default:

     	         }
