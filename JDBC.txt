JDBC
-------
JDBC is the Java Database Connectivity Technology . JDBC is an API for the java programming language that defines how a client may access a Database . It provides methods for querying and updating data in database .

JDBC Supports 
--------------------
-Two tier Architecture 
-Three tier Architecture 
processing models for database

In Two Tier Architecture

JAVA APPLICATION -----DBMS-proprietary protocol(Network)----->DATABASE SERVER
(JDBC)Client Machine                                                                        Database Server

In Three Tier Architecture

  JAVA APPLICATION ------>Application Server(java) JDBC  --------------------DBMS-proprietary protocol(Network)--------->DATABASE SERVER 
(GUI)Client Machine         Server machine(Business Logic / Middle Tier)                                                                           (Database Server)

JDBC Architecture 
-----------------------
1. JDBC API - Application -to-Jdbc Manager Connection . 
2. JDBC Driver API - JDBC Manager-to-Driver Connection . 

Java Application ---> JDBC API---->JDBC DRIVER MANAGER -----> JDBC Driver ------> Database     

Driver Manager 
-------------------
The basic service for managing a set of JDBC drivers . Used to match the connection request from a java application with the proper database driver using the communication sub-protocol . Class.forName is used to load and register a driver with the driver manager .
