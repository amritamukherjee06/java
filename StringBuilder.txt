StringBuilder
-----------------
-String is immutable that means any modification to a string results in the creation of a new string , and there are times when we need to efficiently manipulate strings and that's why we use StringBuilder . 
- StringBuilder provides mutable string buffer . 
    - For best performance pre-size buffer 
            - Will grow automatically if needed
     - Most common methods : append and insert 
     - Use toString to extract resulting string
