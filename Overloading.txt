Overloading
----------------
A class may have multiple versions of its constructor methods or constructors which is known as overloading.

Each constructor and method must have a unique signature 
    - Name
    - Number of parameters
    - Types of each parameter 

In overloading the constructor and method must have same name but the other signatures must be different .
