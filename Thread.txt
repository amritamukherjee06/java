Multithreading
---------------------
Running several threads of computation at the same time in the same process . 
This threads 
- share memory and resources , 
- likely to have lower overheads than processes
- part of the same program . 
- cannot exist outside of the process lifetime . 
- Threads are often seen as lightweight processes .

Concurrency
-----------------
When a task is broken down into smaller pieces and run simultaneously.

It is achieved by 
- Tasks (processes) in multitasking
- Threads in multithreading
- Distribution of work across a grid or the cloud
